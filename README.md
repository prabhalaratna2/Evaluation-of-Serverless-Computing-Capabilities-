# Evaluation-of-Serverless-Computing-Capabilities

Fibo_Lambda
* Calculates the last term of fibonacci series in a specified range for random numbers and fixed numbers in AWS Lambda using Node.js.
Fibo_Azure
* Calculates the last term of fibonacci series in a specified range for random numbers and fixed numbers in Azure using Node.js.
Ranges
* Low :- 1-100
* Medium :- 1001-50000
* High :- 50001-100000
Investigated the following research questions: 
RQ-1:	How many concurrent executions does Lambda and Azure support for Fibonacci code?
RQ-2:	Which serverless platform performs better for heavy loads?
RQ-3:	Which serverless cloud platform is better in terms of cost?
